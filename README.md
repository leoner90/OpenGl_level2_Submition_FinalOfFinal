# FirstTerrain

## Overview

**FirstTerrain** is an introductory project designed for 3D Graphics Programming students to start working with **outdoor** scenery. It provides a foundational setup for exploring 3D rendering concepts.

## Scene Description

- The scene includes:
  - A **terrain** based on a simple height map
  - A **road** terrain object, also based on a height map - providing colour (material) difference
  
**Note**: The scene is implemented using the **fixed pipeline** and contains **deprecated code**.

## Usage

1. Use this scene to practice setting up and rendering indoor environments.
2. Familiarize yourself with the provided models and experiment with lighting, textures, and other scene enhancements.
3. Convert the scene to the **programmable pipeline** and eliminate all **deprecated code**.
